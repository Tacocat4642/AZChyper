# AZCypher
It's a Cypher.

It maps each lowercase letter to the corrosponding letter on the opposite side of the alphabet.
For example: solution("z") will return "a", solution("b") will return "y", and so on.

It will ignore everything that isn't a lowercase english letter (punctuation, uppercase, Japanese, etc.)

There wasn't really any reason for me to push this. I just wanted the serotonin from uploading a project to github.

# Usage
1. Download AZCypher.py
2. Add the code print(solution("sample_phrase") at the bottom
3. Replace sample_phrase with whatever you want to encode/decode

--> Code will print result

# Use Cases
- Decoding nefarious messages from certain space minions.
